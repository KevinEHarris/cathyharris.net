            A <em>get</em> HTTP request is limited to the amount of data you can pass to the server.  With a get
            request the data is placed on the URL. The maximum length of a URL is typically limited to 2048 characters.  If you need more data you can use a post request which places the returned data
            in the message body of the response.

            Post requests can send larger amount of data to the server as it is stored in the message body.  The larger amounts
            of data may be from a form which is filled out on the web page and needs to sent to the server for
            processing.
            Post requests are a little more secure because the data being sent is not stored in browser history or in web server logs.


            A fundamental difference between the post and get requests is that a post indicates that something will be changed on the server,
            while a get request does not change the server state (i.e. get requests should be idempotent). This is why browsers will sometimes
            prompt you when resubmitting a post request, as the server may be changed to a different state on the resubmit.  Also
            post requests are not cached in the browser, while typically get requests will be cached in the browser.

            jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/post/" target="_blank">.post()</a> is used to
            post data to a server and retrieve results. .post() can also be used to interact with
            web services (e.g. WCF service).
            The .post() function has a call signature which looks identical to the .get() call.

            <br />
            .post( url [, data ] [, complete ] )<br />
            url - A string containing the URL to which the request is sent.
            data - A plain object or string that is sent to the server with the request.
            complete - A callback function that is executed when the request completes.
